1. My goal is to become a web developer. I try to use all my free time to learn something new, I like the learning process and I hope that I will never lose my craving for it. I know how to google well and I think that you can do anything just with Google. At the moment I work as a specialist in technical protection of information (little connected with IT)..
1. I have basic knowledge in C #, Java, JavaScript, SQL, PHP. I read a little about algorithms and watched MITs lectures about this topic.
1. [Code examples on codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/users/dmtaddict)
```javascript
function func(argument) {
  if(argument) {
    alert("Hello world");
  }
}
```
1. I have little experience developing a C# program that implements a method for calculating a some value for my work. Without this program, my work would have been impossible from a certain date. The program itself is simple, but it has a lot of mathematics (logarithms, integrals, etc.)
1. Higher education. Specialty: Information security. Graduated from Novosibirsk State Technical University in 2013. 
1. I studied English only at the university and in films / games. I can freely read the technical text, but I canâ€™t correctly compose the proposal myself. I can understand only clear and slow speech.
